User API key. Could use `CTFD_API_KEY` environment variable instead. Despite being the most convenient way to
authenticate yourself, we do not recommend it as you will probably generate a long-live token without any rotation
policy.

The administrator or service account password to login with. Could use `CTFD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable

CTFd base URL (e.g. `https://my-ctf.lan`). Could use `CTFD_URL` environment variable instead.
